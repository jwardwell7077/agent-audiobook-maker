# Database Schema Overview

The current spans-first two-stage annotation system does not require a database
by default. Character tracking features are planned but optional. For historical
designs referencing a PostgreSQL character database, see the deprecated legacy
documents in this folder.

- Current state: No DB required for annotation pipeline
- Optional: Character DB for advanced casting and long-form consistency (future)
