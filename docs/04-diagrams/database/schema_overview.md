# Database Schema Overview

The current spans-first two-stage annotation system does not require a database by default. Character tracking features are planned but optional. For historical designs referencing a PostgreSQL character database have been removed from v0 to keep the system lean and focused. A future optional DB may be added for long-form character consistency and casting.

- Current state: No DB required for annotation pipeline
- Optional: Character DB for advanced casting and long-form consistency (future)
