# COMPONENT_NAME â€” Full Design Spec

Status: Draft Owner: OWNER Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

- Purpose and scope
- Assumptions and constraints

## Diagrams

- Architecture (Mermaid)
- UML (class or sequence)
- Data diagram (ERD/class) if applicable
- FSM (if applicable)

## Contracts

- Inputs (types, shapes, file paths)
- Outputs (types, shapes, file paths)
- Invariants and guarantees
- Error modes and edge cases

## Requirements

1. R-QUALITY-GATE: Component passes the quality gate (ruff clean, 100% Google-style docstrings, 100% test coverage for the component path).

## Task Plan

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2

## Test Plan (pytest)

- Map tests 1:1 to Requirements (happy path + at least one edge case)
- Fixture/data strategy
- Coverage: enforce 100% for the component path (pytest-cov), and validate docstring coverage at 100%.

## Out of Scope

- Deferred items

## Open Questions

- TBD
