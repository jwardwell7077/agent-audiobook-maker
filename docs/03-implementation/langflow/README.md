# LangFlow Implementation

> **Purpose**: Visual workflow prototyping for the Agent Audiobook Maker annotation pipeline using LangFlow, evolving toward a spans-first two-stage system.

This is our current implementation approach for Phase 1 - using LangFlow's visual interface to rapidly prototype and validate the annotation pipeline. The system is transitioning from basic segmentation to a spans-first two-stage architecture featuring dialogue classification and deterministic speaker attribution before moving to a production multi-agent system.

Annotation system integration: The pipeline now incorporates hybrid dialogue classification (heuristic + AI fallback) and deterministic speaker attribution with optional PostgreSQL character database integration.

## Current Components

### Chapter Volume Loader

Loads book chapters from structured JSON or fallback text files

- Input: Book ID and manifest path
- Output: Structured payload with book metadata and chapters
- Features: Automatic fallback to .txt files if JSON unavailable
- Status: âœ… Working and tested

### Segment Dialogue/Narration

**Legacy Component** (being upgraded to spans-first two-stage)

Splits chapter text into dialogue and narration utterances

- Input: Chapter payload with text content
- Output: Utterances array with role classification (dialogue/narration)
- Algorithm: Quote-based heuristic detection
- Status: âœ… Working, transitioning to hybrid dialogue classifier agent
- **Migration**: Will be enhanced with AI classification fallback and confidence scoring

**Future Enhancement**: This component is evolving into the Dialogue Classifier Agent with:

- Hybrid heuristic + AI classification approach
- Context window analysis (5-segment windows)
- Confidence scoring for classification accuracy
- Support for mixed dialogue/narration segments

### Chapter Selector

Selects specific chapter by index for processing

- Input: Multi-chapter payload and chapter index
- Output: Single chapter payload for downstream processing
- Features: Bounds checking and validation
- Status: âœ… Working and tested

### Utterance JSONL Writer

Writes utterances to JSONL files for persistence

- Input: Utterances payload with book/chapter metadata
- Output: File path and processing statistics
- Features: Automatic directory creation, filename templates
- Status: âœ… Working with configurable paths

### Utterance Filter

Filters utterances by role, length, or content criteria

- Input: Utterances payload with filter parameters
- Output: Filtered utterances matching criteria
- Features: Role filtering, length bounds, substring matching
- Status: âœ… Working with multiple filter types

### Speaker Attribution Agent

**New Component** (part of two-agent system)

Associates dialogue segments with specific characters using database-driven lookup

- Input: Dialogue segments from Dialogue Classifier Agent
- Output: Speaker-attributed dialogue with character associations
- Features: Character database integration, alias resolution, confidence scoring
- Database: PostgreSQL with JSONB character profiles
- Status: ðŸš§ Architecture complete, implementation in progress

Key capabilities:

- Real-time character lookup by name and aliases
- Automatic character record creation for new speakers
- Speaker vs addressee detection in dialogue
- Character profile building for voice casting integration

## Workflow Examples

### Legacy Basic Segmentation Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Volume Loader] --> B[Chapter Selector]
    B --> C[Segment D/N]
    C --> D[JSONL Writer]
    D --> E[File Output]
```

This flow loads a book volume, selects a specific chapter, segments it into dialogue/narration utterances, and writes the results to a JSONL file.

### Two-stage Annotation Flow (New Architecture)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Volume Loader] --> B[Chapter Selector]
    B --> C[Dialogue Classifier Agent]
    C --> D[Speaker Attribution Agent]
    D --> E[(Character Database)]
    D --> F[JSONL Writer]
    F --> G[File Output]
```

The enhanced flow incorporates the two-stage system with database-driven character tracking and deterministic speaker attribution.

### Filtered Processing Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Volume Loader] --> B[Chapter Selector]
    B --> C[Dialogue Classifier Agent]
    C --> D[Speaker Attribution Agent] 
    D --> E[Utterance Filter]
    E --> F[JSONL Writer]
    F --> G[File Output]
```

This flow adds filtering capabilities after speaker attribution to remove unwanted utterances before final output.

## Development Status

- **Phase**: Transitioning from rapid prototyping to spans-first two-stage architecture
