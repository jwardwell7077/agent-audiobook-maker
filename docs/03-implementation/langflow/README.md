# LangFlow Implementation

> Purpose: Visual workflow prototyping for the Agent Audiobook Maker segmentation pipeline using LangFlow.

This is our current implementation approach for the KISS branchâ€”using LangFlow's visual interface to prototype deterministic segmentation. The focus is on dialogue/narration segmentation and writing JSONL artifacts. Speaker attribution, databases, and multiâ€‘agent systems are out of scope here.

## Current Components

### Chapter Volume Loader

Loads book chapters from structured JSON or fallback text files

- Input: Book ID and manifest path
- Output: Structured payload with book metadata and chapters
- Features: Automatic fallback to .txt files if JSON unavailable
- Status: âœ… Working and tested

### Span Classification (Dialogue/Narration)

Labels spans as dialogue or narration deterministically.

- Input: Spans from the resolver
- Output: spans_cls with role classification (dialogue/narration)
- Algorithm: Quote and hint-based simple rules
- Status: âœ… Working

### Chapter Selector

Selects specific chapter by index for processing

- Input: Multi-chapter payload and chapter index
- Output: Single chapter payload for downstream processing
- Features: Bounds checking and validation
- Status: âœ… Working and tested

### Utterance JSONL Writer

Writes utterances to JSONL files for persistence

- Input: Utterances payload with book/chapter metadata
- Output: File path and processing statistics
- Features: Automatic directory creation, filename templates
- Status: âœ… Working with configurable paths

### Utterance Filter

Filters utterances by role, length, or content criteria

- Input: Utterances payload with filter parameters
- Output: Filtered utterances matching criteria
- Features: Role filtering, length bounds, substring matching
- Status: âœ… Working with multiple filter types

### Out of Scope (KISS)

- Speaker attribution and character databases
- Multi-agent systems
- Orchestration frameworks

## Workflow Examples

### Legacy Basic Segmentation Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Volume Loader] --> B[Chapter Selector]
    B --> C[Segment D/N]
    C --> D[JSONL Writer]
    D --> E[File Output]
```

This flow loads a book volume, selects a specific chapter, segments it into dialogue/narration utterances, and writes the results to a JSONL file.

### Spans-first Segmentation Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Chapter Loader] --> B[Block Schema Validator]
    B --> C[Mixed Block Resolver]
    C --> D[Span Classifier]
    D --> E[JSONL Writer]
    E --> F[File Output]
```

### Filtered Processing Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Volume Loader] --> B[Chapter Selector]
    B --> C[Dialogue Classifier Agent]
    C --> D[Speaker Attribution Agent]
    D --> E[Utterance Filter]
    E --> F[JSONL Writer]
    F --> G[File Output]
```

This flow adds filtering capabilities after speaker attribution to remove unwanted utterances before final output.

## Development Status

- Phase: KISS segmentation prototype
- Custom components: Loader, validator, resolver, classifier, iterator, orchestrator
- Database integration: Out of scope
- Next: Casting design note â†’ SSML â†’ TTS (future)

## Architecture Evolution

### Current State (Legacy LangFlow)

- Basic heuristic dialogue/narration segmentation
- File-based processing and output
- Limited character awareness

### Target State (Later)

- Casting and character bible
- SSML assembly
- TTS rendering
