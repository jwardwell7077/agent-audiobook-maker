## Development Philosophy

### 💎 [KISS Principle](../01-project-overview/KISS.md)

**Keep It Simple, Stupid - Our approach to system design**

Core design philosophy guiding all technical decisions:

- **Simplicity first**: Choose the simplest solution that works
- **Progressive complexity**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- **Maintainability**: Code that future developers can understand and modify
- **Decision framework**: How to evaluate complexity trade-offs

*Reference this document when making design decisions or evaluating technical approaches.*

### 🏗️ Architecture Principles

**Key principles guiding system design:**

1. **Modular components** - Clear boundaries and interfaces
2. **Data-driven decisions** - Validate with real content before optimizing
3. **Fail fast, learn quickly** - Rapid iteration and validation
4. **Human-centric design** - Tools that augment human capability
5. **Production readiness** - Consider scalability and reliability early

## Development Processes
