# GitHub Projects Policy (KISS)

- Labels:
  - type:feature, type:bug, type:infra, type:doc, agent-task, blocked, prio:high, prio:med, prio:low
- Milestones:
  - v0.1 KISS, v0.2 Casting & SSML, v0.3 TTS + E2E Demo
- Project Board:
  - Columns: Backlog → Selected → In Progress (WIP ≤3) → Review → Done
  - Auto-add new issues to the board
  - Each issue must have a milestone and acceptance criteria

This repo keeps ceremony minimal and uses only GitHub-native tooling.
