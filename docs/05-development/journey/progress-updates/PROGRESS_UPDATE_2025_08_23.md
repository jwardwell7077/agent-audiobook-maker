# Development Progress: MVP Specification & Advanced Speaker Attribution

**Date:** 2025-08-23  
**Branch:** langflow  
**Status:** Architecture Complete, Ready for Implementation  

## Summary of Work Completed

### **Major Deliverables Created**

1. **`docs/MVP_SPECIFICATION.md`** - Complete MVP definition with:
   - Clear scope boundaries (IN vs OUT of scope)  
   - 95% F1 speaker attribution target
   - Measurable success criteria and KPIs
   - Technical requirements and dependencies
   - User stories and acceptance criteria
   - 4-phase development timeline
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

2. **`docs/ADVANCED_SPEAKER_ATTRIBUTION.md`** - Technical strategy for 95% F1 target:
   - 4-model ensemble approach (Rule-based, NER+Coref, LLM, Embeddings)
   - Multi-layered architecture design
   - Conversation state management
   - Character bible integration
   - Performance optimization strategies
   - 3-week implementation roadmap

3. **`docs/LANGFLOW_COMPONENT_PLAN.md`** - Enhanced component architecture:
   - 15 custom components planned (vs 6 originally)
   - Advanced speaker attribution system
   - Performance tracking and monitoring
   - Clear rebuild strategy for existing broken components

### **Key Architectural Decisions**

#### **Performance Targets Elevated**

- **Before**: 80% F1 speaker attribution "good enough"
- **After**: 95% F1 speaker attribution with professional-grade accuracy
- **Impact**: Requires sophisticated multi-model ensemble approach

#### **Component Strategy Refined**

- **Before**: Simple heuristic-based segmentation
- **After**: Advanced multi-layered attribution pipeline with:
  - Rule-based patterns (attribution phrases, action beats)
  - Coreference resolution (SpanBERT-coref model)  
  - LLM-based complex attribution (Llama 3.1 8B)
  - Character embedding similarity matching

#### **System Architecture Enhanced**

- **Conversation State Management**: Track speaker context across dialogue sequences
- **Character Bible Integration**: Persistent character profiles and voice mapping
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking toward 95% F1 goal
- **Deterministic Caching**: Hash-based reproducible outputs

### **Technical Approach Validated**

The **95% F1 speaker attribution target** is achievable through:

1. **Ensemble Methodology**: 4 complementary models with weighted voting
2. **Cascading Performance**: Fast models first, complex models only for uncertainty  
3. **Local-First Processing**: No cloud dependencies, all inference local
4. **Incremental Validation**: Weekly progress tracking against test dataset

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

- **Fallback Systems**: Multiple attribution techniques prevent single points of failure
- **Confidence Thresholding**: Mark uncertain cases as UNKNOWN rather than guessing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking prevents scope creep
- **Iterative Development**: 3-week phases allow course correction

## Current State Assessment

### **âœ… Architecture & Planning: COMPLETE**

- MVP scope clearly defined with measurable criteria
- Technical approach validated with concrete implementation plan  
- Component architecture designed for 95% F1 target
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies documented

### **ðŸ”„ Next Phase: LangFlow Component Implementation**

- **Goal**: Rebuild all 6 existing components + add 9 new components
- **Priority**: Get basic pipeline functional in LangFlow UI first
- **Timeline**: Focus on Phase 1 components (segmentation â†’ JSONL output)

### **ðŸ“‹ Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Commit current documentation** - Capture architectural decisions
2. **Rebuild core LangFlow components** - Focus on basic functionality first  
3. **Establish component testing** - Ensure each component works in LangFlow UI
4. **Build toward Phase 2** - Advanced speaker attribution implementation

## Implementation Priority

### **Phase 1: Core Pipeline (Week 1)**

1. **ABMChapterVolumeLoader** - Load volume manifest + chapter selection
2. **ABMSegmentDialogueNarration** - Basic dialogue/narration segmentation  
3. **ABMUtteranceJSONLWriter** - Write utterances to annotation schema
4. **ABMPayloadLogger** - Debug and monitor data flow

**Success Criteria**: End-to-end PDF â†’ JSONL workflow functional in LangFlow

### **Phase 2: Advanced Attribution (Weeks 2-3)**  

5. **ABMAdvancedSpeakerAttributor** - Multi-model ensemble system
6. **ABMConversationStateManager** - Context and turn-taking tracking
7. **ABMPerformanceTracker** - Monitor progress toward 95% F1

**Success Criteria**: 95% F1 speaker attribution on test dataset

## Key Insights & Lessons

### **Scope Clarity is Critical**

Having a comprehensive MVP specification prevents scope creep and provides clear success criteria. The 95% F1 target is ambitious but achievable with the right technical approach.

### **Multi-Model Ensemble Approach**  

No single technique can achieve 95% speaker attribution accuracy. The ensemble approach with 4 complementary models provides multiple paths to correct attribution.

### **Local-First Architecture**

Maintaining local processing (no cloud dependencies) while achieving professional-grade accuracy requires sophisticated caching and optimization strategies.

### **Component-Based Development**

LangFlow's visual component system is ideal for rapid prototyping and iteration of complex NLP pipelines, especially with proper component testing.

**Next Action**: Commit documentation and begin LangFlow component implementation focused on getting the basic pipeline functional in the UI.
