# How to Document - Agent Audiobook Maker

> **Purpose**: Complete guide for creating, organizing, and maintaining documentation in the Agent Audiobook Maker project.

This guide explains our documentation structure, standards, templates, and best practices to help you contribute effectively to the project's knowledge base.

## Documentation Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **User-Centric**: Documentation serves different audiences with different needs
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Information is organized in logical, navigable sections
- **Living Documentation**: Docs evolve with the codebase and stay current
- **Self-Service**: Users should find answers without asking questions
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to have fewer, excellent docs than many poor ones

### Documentation-First Approach

1. **Design documents** before coding major features
2. **Update docs** with every code change that affects user experience
3. **Test documentation** - ensure examples work and instructions are clear
4. **Review docs** as part of the code review process

## Documentation Structure

### 6-Section Hierarchy

Our documentation follows a 6-section structure designed for different user types and needs:

```text
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Main documentation index
â”œâ”€â”€ GETTING_STARTED.md          # New contributor onboarding
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-project-overview/        # Vision, architecture, context
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-specifications/          # Technical requirements
â”œâ”€â”€ 03-implementation/          # How the system is built
â”œâ”€â”€ 04-diagrams/                # Visual documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ 05-development/             # Contributor resources
â””â”€â”€ 06-appendices/              # Reference materials
```text

### Section Purposes

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Standards

**Required Elements**:

- **Purpose statement** - Every document starts with `> **Purpose**: ...`
- **Clear headings** - Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 â†’ H2 â†’ H3)
- **Navigation aids** - Breadcrumbs, cross-references, "Related Sections"
- **Examples** - Include code examples and practical usage
- **Context** - Explain why, not just what

**Formatting Requirements**:

- **Line length**: Aim for 80 characters, max 120
- **Blank lines**: Around headings, lists, and code blocks
- **Code blocks**: Always specify language (`python`, `bash`, `json`)
- **Links**: Use descriptive text, not bare URLs
- **Lists**: Consistent formatting with blank lines around

### Content Standards

**Writing Guidelines**:

- **Active voice**: "The system processes data" not "Data is processed"
- **Present tense**: "The component returns results" not "will return"
- **Specific examples**: Show real code, real data, real scenarios
- **User perspective**: Write for the person who needs to use this information

**Structure Guidelines**:

- **Start with overview**: What is this and why does it matter?
- **Provide context**: How does this fit into the bigger picture?
- **Include examples**: Show practical usage
- **Add troubleshooting**: Anticipate common problems
- **Link related content**: Help users find connected information

### Quality Checklist

- [ ] **Purpose is clear** - Reader understands why this document exists
- [ ] **Audience is appropriate** - Content matches the intended users
- [ ] **Examples work** - Code samples execute successfully
- [ ] **Links are valid** - All internal and external links work
- [ ] **Navigation is complete** - Breadcrumbs and cross-references included

## Mermaid diagrams: authoring and embedding

This project uses Mermaid for diagrams. Follow these rules to avoid GitHub rendering errors and flaky parsing.

### When creating standalone diagram files (`*.mmd` in `docs/04-diagrams/**`)

- Store RAW Mermaid DSL only. Do NOT wrap in a code fence.
  - First non-comment line must be the diagram directive, e.g. `flowchart LR` or `classDiagram`.
- Keep comments on their own lines using `%%`.
- Examples:

  - Flowchart file:
    
    flowchart LR
      PDF[PDF file] -->|"PyMuPDF / fitz"| EXTRACT[Extract pages]
      EXTRACT --> CLEAN[Normalize & clean]
      CLEAN --> TXT[Write .txt]
    
  - Class diagram file:
    
    classDiagram
      direction TB
      Component <|-- ABMChapterVolumeLoader
      ABMCacheManager ..> ABMTTSRenderer : caches
    

### When embedding diagrams inside Markdown (`.md`)

- Use a single fenced block with the language `mermaid`.
- Put the directive (`flowchart LR`, `classDiagram`, etc.) as the first line inside the fence.
- Do not nest fences or add blank lines immediately after ```mermaid.
- Example:
  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    A --> B
  ```

### GitHub-specific pitfalls and fixes

- Parentheses and special characters in edge labels can break parsing.
  - Prefer to avoid `(` and `)` in labels; if needed, wrap the label in double quotes: `-->|"Call (fitz)"|`.
  - Safer alternative: replace with `/` or `-` (e.g., `PyMuPDF / fitz`).
- Donâ€™t use `mermaid.radar` or custom fence languagesâ€”only `mermaid` is supported by GitHub.
- Donâ€™t duplicate diagram directives (e.g., avoid `classDiagram` on two consecutive lines).
- Class diagram relations use UML arrows, not flowchart link syntax:
  - Dependency: `..>`
  - Realization: `..|>`
  - Inheritance: `<|--`
  - Aggregation: `o--`
  - Composition: `*--`
  - Association: `-->` or `--`
  - Do NOT use `-.->` (thatâ€™s a flowchart dotted link). Use `..>` in class diagrams instead.
- Edge label syntax for flowcharts:
  - `A -->|text| B` or `A -- text --> B`
  - Quote labels if they include punctuation: `A -->|"Link (v1)"| B`
- Keep a direction line for readability in large diagrams: `direction TB` or `direction LR` (class diagrams only).

### Validation and tests

- We include unit tests to validate Mermaid syntax and catch regressions.
  - Run just the Mermaid tests:

    pytest tests/unit_tests/test_mermaid_*.py -q

- Locally preview in VS Code with a Mermaid extension, or use the projectâ€™s validator where available.

### Naming and organization

- Place flow/process diagrams under `docs/04-diagrams/flows/`.
- Place UML class diagrams under `docs/04-diagrams/uml/`.
- Architecture/system overviews under `docs/04-diagrams/architecture/`.
- Use `snake_case` filenames that reflect content, e.g., `pdf_to_text_flow.mmd`, `langflow_uml.mmd`.

### Quick checklist (before committing)

- No code fences in `.mmd` files.
- First line is the correct directive.
- No duplicate directives.
- Labels with punctuation are quoted or simplified.
- Class diagram uses UML arrows (e.g., `..>`), not flowchart dotted links.
- File is placed in the correct subfolder and named descriptively.
