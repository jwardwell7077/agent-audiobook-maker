# Getting Started with Agent Audiobook Maker

Welcome! This guide will help you understand and contribute to the Agent Audiobook Maker project.

## What This Project Does

Agent Audiobook Maker transforms long-form PDFs (like novels) into high-quality, multi-voice audiobooks using a local-first, multi-agent pipeline.

```mermaid

    PDF[PDF Novel] --> Extract[Extract Text]
    Extract --> Annotate[Annotate Dialogue]
    Annotate --> Cast[Cast Voices] 
    Cast --> Render[Render Audio]
    Render --> Master[Master Audiobook]
```

## Current Status

We're in **Phase 1** of development:

- ✅ **Phase 0**: PDF ingestion with deterministic chapter extraction (COMPLETE)
- 🚧 **Phase 1**: LangFlow prototype for dialogue/narration segmentation (IN PROGRESS)
- ⏳ **Phase 2**: Multi-agent speaker attribution and emotion analysis (PLANNED)
- ⏳ **Phase 3**: TTS rendering with voice casting (PLANNED)

## Quick Setup (KISS Approach)

This project follows KISS principles - Keep It Simple, Simple. You only need:

1. **Python 3.11** and a local virtual environment
2. **Basic dev tools** for testing and linting
3. **No heavy dependencies** until you need them

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/jwardwell7077/agent-audiobook-maker.git
cd agent-audiobook-maker

# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv .venv || python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dev dependencies
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Verify setup
make test
```

## Understanding the Architecture

Start with these documents in order:

1. **[Project Tenets](01-project-overview/KISS.md)** - Core principles (KISS, local-first, deterministic)
2. **[System Context](01-project-overview/CONTEXT.md)** - Technical constraints and goals  
3. **[High-Level Architecture](01-project-overview/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System overview
4. **[Current Implementation](03-implementation/langflow/README.md)** - What's working now

## Key Concepts

### Local-First

- Files on disk are the source of truth
- Works offline by default  
- No cloud dependencies required

### Deterministic

- Same input always produces identical output
- Content-addressed hashing for reproducibility
- Essential for testing and validation

### Multi-Agent

- Different AI agents handle specific tasks
- Speaker identification, emotion analysis, quality assurance
- Currently prototyping with LangFlow, evolving to CrewAI

## Development Workflow

1. **Read the specs** - We follow spec-first development
2. **Write tests first** - TDD approach with pytest
3. **Implement incrementally** - Small, verifiable changes
4. **Pass quality gates** - Ruff, mypy, pytest must all pass

## Common Tasks

### Running the Ingestion Pipeline

```bash
# Process a PDF into structured chapters
python -m abm.ingestion.pdf_to_text_cli input.pdf
```

### Working with LangFlow Components

```bash
# Install LangFlow (optional - only for visual prototyping)
pip install langflow

# Run LangFlow with custom components
./scripts/run_langflow.sh
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage  
make test_coverage

# Run quality checks
make quality_gate
```
