# Getting Started with Agent Audiobook Maker

Welcome! This guide will help you understand and contribute to the Agent Audiobook Maker project.

## What This Project Does

Agent Audiobook Maker transforms long-form PDFs (like novels) into high-quality, multi-voice audiobooks using a local-first, multi-agent pipeline.

```mermaid

    PDF["PDF Novel"] --> Extract["Extract Text"]
    Extract --> Annotate["Annotate Dialogue"]
    Annotate --> Cast["Cast Voices"]
    Cast --> Render["Render Audio"]
    Render --> Master["Master Audiobook"]
```

## Current Status

We're in **Phase 1** of development:

- ‚úÖ **Phase 0**: PDF ingestion with deterministic chapter extraction (COMPLETE)
- üöß **Phase 1**: Script authoring + deterministic segmentation (IN PROGRESS)
- ‚è≥ **Phase 2**: Multi-agent speaker attribution and emotion analysis (PLANNED)
- ‚è≥ **Phase 3**: TTS rendering with voice casting (PLANNED)

## Quick Setup (KISS Approach)

This project follows KISS principles - Keep It Simple, Simple. You only need:

1. **Python 3.11** and a local virtual environment
1. **Basic dev tools** for testing and linting
1. **No heavy dependencies** until you need them

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/jwardwell7077/agent-audiobook-maker.git
cd agent-audiobook-maker

# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv .venv || python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dev dependencies
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Verify setup
make test
```

## Understanding the Architecture

Start with these documents in order:

1. **[Project Tenets](01-project-overview/KISS.md)** - Core principles (KISS, local-first, deterministic)
1. **[System Context](01-project-overview/CONTEXT.md)** - Technical constraints and goals
1. **[High-Level Architecture](01-project-overview/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System overview
1. **[Current Implementation](03-implementation/README.md)** - What's working now

## Key Concepts

### Local-First

- Files on disk are the source of truth
- Works offline by default
- No cloud dependencies required

### Deterministic

- Same input always produces identical output
- Content-addressed hashing for reproducibility
- Essential for testing and validation

### Multi-Agent

- Different AI agents handle specific tasks
- Speaker identification, emotion analysis, quality assurance
- Currently building pure Python authoring modules, evolving to CrewAI

## Development Workflow

1. **Read the specs** - We follow spec-first development
1. **Write tests first** - TDD approach with pytest
1. **Implement incrementally** - Small, verifiable changes
1. **Pass quality gates** - Ruff, mypy, pytest must all pass

## Common Tasks

### Running the Ingestion Pipeline

```bash
# Ingest a PDF ‚Üí raw + well-done text
python -m abm.ingestion.ingest_pdf input.pdf --mode both
```

<!-- Removed LangFlow components section (deprecated) -->

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage  
make test_coverage

# Run quality checks
make quality_gate
```

### Installing Piper voices (for TTS)

Piper models are not bundled; you need to download voice files locally. We provide a small helper script that installs a few English voices for auditioning.

- Default location: `~/.local/share/piper/voices`
- Alternative: set `ABM_PIPER_VOICES_DIR=/path/to/voices`

Steps:

1. Install a few voices locally (downloads ~100‚Äì200MB total):
  - Run: `scripts/install_piper_voices.sh` (destination optional)
2. Verify discovery:
  - Run: `python -m abm.voice.piper_catalog --json`
  - You should see entries like `en_US-ryan-high`, `en_US-amy-medium`, etc.
3. Propose a casting scaffold and audition lines:
  - Run: `python -m abm.voice.piper_casting --profiles data/voices/mvs_cast.yaml --annotations data/ann/mvs/combined_refined.json --out reports/piper_cast`
  - Check `reports/piper_cast/REVIEW.md` for quick audition commands.

Notes:
- Voices are separate assets from the Piper binary; see the upstream VOICES list for more options.
- The `reports/` and `data/` folders are gitignored to avoid committing media or private artifacts.
- To install many voices, use the bulk script (large download; use filters):
  - List only: `scripts/install_piper_voices_all.sh --lang en --list-only`
  - Install English voices: `scripts/install_piper_voices_all.sh --lang en --yes`
  - Install high/medium US English: `scripts/install_piper_voices_all.sh --lang en_US --quality "high|medium" --yes`
