# Advanced Specifications

> **Purpose**: Complex features, system-wide specifications, and advanced capabilities that extend beyond individual components.

This section contains specifications for sophisticated features that involve multiple components, machine learning models, or advanced system behaviors. These specs typically have higher implementation complexity and may require specialized knowledge.

## Current Advanced Features

### üß† [Advanced Speaker Attribution](ADVANCED_SPEAKER_ATTRIBUTION.md)

**Machine learning-based speaker identification for dialogue**

A sophisticated approach to identifying speakers in dialogue using:

- Context analysis and coreference resolution
- Machine learning models for speaker clustering
- Confidence scoring and quality assurance
- Integration with multi-agent validation workflow

**Complexity Level**: High - Requires ML expertise and training data
**Dependencies**: HuggingFace transformers, local ML models
**Target Phase**: Phase 2 (Multi-Agent System)

### üìã [MVP Specification](MVP_SPECIFICATION.md)  

**Minimum viable product definition and acceptance criteria**

Comprehensive definition of what constitutes a successful MVP for the Agent Audiobook Maker:

- Core feature requirements and boundaries
- Quality thresholds and performance targets
- Integration test scenarios and validation criteria
- Success metrics and user acceptance tests

**Complexity Level**: Medium - Cross-cutting system concerns
**Dependencies**: All core components
**Target Phase**: Phase 1-2 transition

## Planned Advanced Features
