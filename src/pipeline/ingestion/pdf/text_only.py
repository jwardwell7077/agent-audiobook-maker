"""Minimal PDF->text extraction utilities (PyMuPDF-only).

This module intentionally provides a very small surface:
- pdf_to_text(Path|str) -> str
- pdf_to_text_file(Path|str, out: Path|str|None) -> Path

No page objects, no warnings list, no multi-backend logic. It is designed
for simple pipelines that just need the full text. Use the richer
`extract.py` if you need pages, metadata, or postprocessing.
